Gitflow
=======
by Ethan Ruffing

Git flow is a workflow for branching in the Git version control system. It was
originally proposed by Vincent Driessen on his blog at [nvie](http://nvie.com/).

The original post documenting this workflow can be found
[here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and a practical
introduction
[is provided](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/)
in the [Atlassian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/) on using
Git.

Either of these are a good place to start for learning the basics of this
workflow; I personally prefer the original post.

It is worth noting that SourceTree, Atlassian's version control client, has
built-in support for gitflow, allowing you to use this workflow easily. It will
take care of the steps needed to perform merges and deletions of branches,
letting you think of the branching system at a higher level, and allowing you to
focus more on the work of programming.
