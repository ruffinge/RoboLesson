Markdown
========

An overview by Ethan Ruffing

Markdown is designed to be a universal markup language. One of the primary goals
of Markdown is that the source files should be readable as-is. That is, they
should appear well-formatted and cleanly laid out in their plain text version,
in addition to being easily interpreted for translation to other formats (such
as HTML, LaTeX, PDF, etc.).

Although Markdown can be interpreted from any plain-text file, it is best
practice to use the suffix `.md`.

GitHub-Flavored Markdown
------------------------
The most common variant of Markdown is GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM), which
adds several features to the list of recognized layouts. For example, there
is the ability to add syntax-highlighted code blocks, like this:
```c
static void main()
{
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```

A good tutorial on GitHub-Flavored Markdown is provided at the
[GitHub website](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).
